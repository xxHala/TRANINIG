<h2>The Journey to the Lake </h2>
<p> I still remmber going fishing with my grandfather <i> early</i> in the morning to the lake. He would 
wake me up before daylight and we would hop into his old ford truck. The morning <i>breeze</i> would 
gently make me by the time we arrived at the lake. Once there,he would secure my life-vest and we would
jump into the silver boat and head out to his favorite stop. I don't remmber the conversations that much,
but I always enjyoed it just being the two of us and catching the <b>fish</b> .<br />
<h2>The cooking </h2>
No matter what we caught,large or small my grandmother would clean it ,season it and have it fried by lunch time
I wish I had asked her about recipes then, by hindsight is always by <b>20/20</b>. This is why I figured 
I would merge programming skills and create a Recipe using HTML lists.<hr /> <br/> </p>
